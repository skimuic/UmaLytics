# UmaLytics

UmaLytics opens a separate scouting window beside [Uma Drafter](https://drafter.uma.guide). See the players in team slots, their available ranked statistics, and the confirmed live draft.

## Start scouting

1. Extract the package and follow the installation guide.
2. Open or refresh Uma Drafter, then enter a room or spectate a draft.
3. Click the UmaLytics extension icon. Use Lobby for player cards, Draft for confirmed selections, and Umas for team experience.
4. Choose Season or All-time. Leave Lobby Lock unlocked to follow room changes; lock it only when you want to keep the displayed players fixed.

## What is included

The development branch adds **Live / History / Profiles** navigation. History accepts a match code or match-page URL and displays the saved completed draft with the same maps, picks, bans and vetoes layout as Live. Profiles accepts a username, Discord ID or profile URL and opens single-player scouting details. These changes are not yet in the linked 0.3.9 downloads.

History keeps its selected match separate from the live lobby. Any accompanying player statistics are current, not historical snapshots. Name searches show selectable directory matches (up to 50); refine the name or use an exact ID if needed. Neither feature requires an active lobby. Results remain while switching views, but match/search selections reset when the scouting window closes. Unavailable saved drafts and API errors are shown explicitly.

- Starting-room trainer identification, with player identities kept independent of companion images and spectators excluded from the roster.
- Versioned room events and DOM fallback for lobby and draft detection.
- Cached player summaries, selected-scope loading, and explicit private/unavailable states.
- Paced API requests, request cancellation on room changes, and bounded automatic recovery after rate limits.
- Confirmed picks, bans, vetoes, map order and a tiebreaker view.
- Local diagnostics that you can copy when reporting a problem.

## Privacy

This source and its packages respect private ranked stats. They do not request player match-history feeds or reconstruct hidden statistics. Loading a completed match by code displays that match's publicly exposed draft. The community configuration cannot enable hidden-profile reconstruction with a build flag. Public identity, rank or rating may still appear when separately exposed by the site; private detailed statistics remain unavailable, including in profile lookup.

The extension contacts Uma Drafter's services with player identifiers. Scouting state and a bounded diagnostic trace stay in local extension storage. There is no UmaLytics backend, analytics service or automatic diagnostic upload. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

## Expectations

This is the public testing release. Cached data can appear quickly; uncached data depends on the upstream API. HTTP 429 pauses requests rather than bypassing the server's limits. Site changes can affect detection. A player whose room exposes no verified identity cannot be looked up reliably.

Chromium behavior has been observed during a live ranked draft on the preceding candidate. The 0.3.9 changes have automated regression coverage; see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for exact checks and limits. Firefox remains an unsigned temporary add-on, not a permanent store installation. Human team cards currently assume up to five slots per side; complete support for every custom mode is not claimed.

## Development and feedback

Built with TypeScript, React and WXT. [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) documents tests and reproducible public builds. [The portfolio repository](https://github.com/skimuic/UmaLytics) describes the engineering; this repository serves community downloads and feedback.

Bug reports should include the version, browser, expected/actual behavior and diagnostics copied soon after the problem. Review the report before posting: its status section can include player IDs, room codes and API error paths. Older download assets retain their original contents.
